== About the code

Tron 0xF is written in Abersoft Forth (a fig-Forth 1.1 ported to ZX
Spectrum by John Jones Steele and published by Melbourne House in
1983), using the Afera libray (Marcos Cruz, 2015). See more details in
http://programandala.net/en.program.tron_0xf.html.

== How to run

Open the file <tron_0xf.szx> with your ZX Spectrum emulator.

== How to compile

In order to convert the sources to a TAP file suitable for
Abersoft Forth, with a ZX Spectrum emulator, the fsb converter
has to be installed:

http://programandala.net/en.program.fsb.html

Then enter the Tron 0xF's directory and execute the command `make`.
That will create the file <tron_0xf_compiling.tap>.  Open it with your
emulator.  You will see the start screen of Abersoft Forth.  Then type
the command `LOADT 1 LOAD`. The compilation will take several minutes
at the original speed of ZX Spectrum. The program will run at the end.
