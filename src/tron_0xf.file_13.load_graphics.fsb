  \ This is the last RAM-disc loaded from tape during the
  \ compilation of the game. Its space is used to store some
  \ binary data, with the folling structure:
  \
  \ Used as storage space during the game:
  \
  \ screen 1:           copy of arena attributes (<768 bytes)
  \ screens 2-8:        copy of a whole screen (6912 bytes)
  \
  \ Loaded directly from tape files:
  \
  \ screen 9:           game font (768 bytes)
  \ screens 10 and 11:  graphic title (2048 bytes)

  \ After the binary files have been loaded into the RAM disk,
  \ the loader must stop immediately, else it would erase the
  \ contents of the RAM disk before loading the next RAM disk
  \ from tape (see the Afera module <loader.fsb>). That's why
  \ the Afera module <loaded_execute.fsb> is not used to stop
  \ the loader at the end of the compilation.

  \ First method: make the loader stop and execute `run`:
  \ ' run cfa loaded !

  \ Second method: Clear the return stack and execute `run`:
rp! run
